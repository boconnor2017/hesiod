The first order. Representative of the fundamental forces and physical foundations of the world. Hesiod, the ancient Greek poet (750 and 650 BC), whose work included "Theogony", told the origin story of the gods, their lineages, and the events that led to Zeus's rise to power. Hesiod is generally regarded by Western authors as a major source in Greek mythology, farming techniques, early economic thought, Archaic Greek, astronomy, cosmology, and ancient time-keeping. 

Project Hesiod is a git repository with all necessary bodies of work to begin software development.
